[Giscus](https://giscus.app/) is a comments widget powered by GitHub Discussions. It's a great way to add comments to your static site without relying on third-party services like Disqus or Commento.

I host my Hugo-based website on GitHub Pages and wanted to use Giscus on the same repo for comments. I followed the instructions from [Justing Bird](https://www.justinjbird.me/blog/2023/adding-comments-to-a-hugo-site-using-giscus).

Basics first:

-   My website is hosted in a public repo on Github
-   Its is built with Hugo and deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions
-   Discussions are enabled on the repo (repo settings -> General -> Features -> Discussions)
-   Install Giscus to the repo from <https://github.com/apps/giscus>
-   Get your Giscus script by generating it here: <https://giscus.app/>

Integrating Giscus with Hugo:

I use a [Soho](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/soho/) template that provides functionality for Discus. I've moved all the template files to the `layouts` directory so that my project structure looks like this:

![project layout](/images/project-layout.png)

The Discus code is in `single.html`. I created `giscus.html` in the `partials` directory and editted `single.html` to include `giscus.html` instead of the Discus code. In `config.toml`, I added a parameter `enableGiscusComments` under `[params]` to enable or disable comments.

`giscus.html`:

```html
<script
    src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
    data-repo="SeekoeiD/website"
    data-repo-id="R_kgDOMqEhoQ"
    data-category="General"
    data-category-id="DIC_kwDOMqEhoc4CiUot"
    data-mapping="pathname"
    data-strict="0"
    data-reactions-enabled="1"
    data-emit-metadata="0"
    data-input-position="bottom"
    data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
    data-lang="en"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
    async
></script>
```

`single.html`:

```html
{{ if (.Site.Params.enableGiscusComments) -}}
<div class="comments">
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    {{ partial "giscus.html" . }}
</div>
{{- end }}
```
