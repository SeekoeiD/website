Husband, father, engineer, tickerer, cyclist, trail runner. I'm a [nerd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYE3GtXqDV0) and the "ultra distance" bug has bitten me hard.

I'm an Electrical and Electronic Engineer by training with a Master's degree in Power Electronics. My most notable academic achievements:

-   [Predictive Control of Series Stacked Flying-Capacitor Active Rectifiers](https://sun.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/27US_INST/2fbt29/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1323217273)
-   [Predictive torque control of an induction machine fed by a flying capacitor converter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6071967)
-   [Model predictive control of a flying capacitor converter with output LC filter for UPS applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6071966)
-   [Predictive control for a series stacked flying-capacitor active rectifier](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5975886)
-   [Predictive Control of Series Stacked Flying-Capacitor Active Rectifiers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6331007)

I had a 12 year career at a coal fired [power station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethabo_Power_Station) as an Operational Technology and Control and Instrumentation engineer. I'm also a registered [Professional Engineer](https://www.ecsa.co.za/CustomPages/PersonDetails.aspx?id=20180018) with the Engineering Council of South Africa.

Today I'm full time in the blockchain space as co-founder and senior developer of [SilverSixpence](https://www.silversixpence.io), a blockchain engineering company. We focus on bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology.

For years I've been meaning to start a blog-like website to share "what I learned today" posts. This is it. Let's see how it goes.
